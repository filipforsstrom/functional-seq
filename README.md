# Func-SEQ

*this is a proof of concept and wip...*

With inspiration from [TVIBURAR](https://github.com/linusschrab/tviburar) I started to experiment around the concept of drawing musical sequences. 

Func-SEQ is a musical sequence drawing app inspired by [TVIBURAR](https://github.com/linusschrab/tviburar). It allows you to create lanes with waveforms that represent musical sequences. Each lane can be assigned a waveform where the y-axis represents the frequency and the x-axis represents time. The app also supports quantization, enabling user definied scales. Additionally, each lane has its own quantizer, providing individual control over the quantization settings.

Made with p5js, p5.func, webmidi and tonal.js.
